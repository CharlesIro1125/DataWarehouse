    "The table created for this query, uses the user_id and session_id as the composite partition key to partition the records. A better and more balance distribution is obtain with this composite key, than using a single column like the user_id, since some users visits the app more frequent than others. Adding the session_id to the partition key will force thesame user_id with same session_id to be on thesame node thereby reducing the initial skewness (using only the user_id). Obtaining the query result requires hashing the partition key values \"10\" and \"182\" and identifying the node it is partition. The item_insession column is also used to sort the records in each node, making it efficient for selection. "
